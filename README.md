## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Pro-Level Recoil Control
* **Smart Smoothing:** Breaks down recoil compensation into micro-steps. This eliminates "snappy" robotic movements and makes the crosshair glide naturally.
* **Humanization:** Adds calculated random noise to every movement to mimic human imperfection.
* **Dynamic Axes:** Independent control for Vertical (Y) and Horizontal (X) recoil.

### 🖥️ Interactive Overlay (Quick Menu)
* **In-Game Menu:** Press `INSERT` to open a floating menu over your game.
* **Draggable & Resizable:** Move the menu anywhere on your screen.
* **Opacity Control:** Adjust transparency to keep an eye on the game while tweaking settings.

### ⚙️ Utility Suite
* **Game Library:** Save/Load configs for different games (CS2, Valorant, Apex, etc.).
* **Auto Clicker:** Fully customizable CPS with Hold/Toggle modes.
* **Movement Assist:** Auto-Strafe and Bunny Hop (Bhop) logic included.
* **Custom Crosshair:** Draw an external crosshair directly on your screen.

### 🔒 Security & Stealth
* **Process Masquerading:** The window title automatically changes to *"Audio Controller Driver"* to blend in with system processes.
* **HWID Protection:** Built-in licensing system tied to hardware ID.
* **External Logic:** Draws over the screen without injecting code into the game memory.
